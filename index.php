The economic system based on the principles of the market functions on the basis of the classical form of private property and its modifications, the use of the objects of which historically forms a producer with a specific economic interest.  And all this time negative emotions have been accumulating in each of us.  Elasticity is one of the most important categories of economics.It was first introduced into the economic theory by A.

A person works for the sake of satisfying needs, therefore use value is an eternal category, but it also develops and changes.As use values, all goods are different, and in order to exchange one thing for another, it is necessary that they have a common feature - have a value.  Proactive people turn love into action.  They are counter-dependent - this is another form of addiction that is at the lowest stage of the Continuous Improvement process.  This value is at the heart of the US Declaration of Independence: "We believe it is a self-evident truth: that all people are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." The next principle is service - the idea of ​​contributing to a common cause.  The prerequisites for consumer behavior can be formulated as follows: 1) consumers have a clear idea of ​​their preferences and always prefer more to less; 2) consumers are acting rationally; 3) consumers know exactly the level of their income; 4) the choice of consumers is limited by their income and time. </em></q></p>

Buddhism calls this the "middle way." "Medium" in this case does not mean "compromise", but "higher", like the top of a triangle.  For most people, the paradigm shift towards the "inside-out" is dramatically challenging.This is mainly due to the strong influence of programming and the existing social paradigm of Personality Ethics.  Analysis of consumer movement along the curve from point A to point D reveals important patterns of his preference,from which the marginal replacement rate (MRS) and decreasing marginal replacement rate categories are directly derived.  Their safety depends on the opinions of other people.  It has a healing, therapeutic effect, since it gives a person "psychological oxygen".  The same principle holds true for trading.  Such people become reactive and, in fact, give up, in the hope that nothing bad will happen to them.  We revised our programs, rewrote our scripts and began to allocate in our life schedule the time necessary for the important actions of Square II - deep communication with each other.  Classification of markets The market includes elements directly related to production support, as well as elements of material and monetary circulation.
